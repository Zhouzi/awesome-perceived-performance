## Quotes

### Weight does not need to increase wait

We can often (usually, even) deliver a usable representation of a web page's content very quickly.

* [More Weight Doesn't Mean More Wait](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/weight-wait.html)

### If something is fast, it must be easy

Quick is cheap. (...) Good things take time and are worth waiting for.

* [Wait for It...](http://uxmas.com/2013/wait-for-it)

### Faster doesn’t always equal better

There’s a mantra in the software world that faster is better. Are there moments when intentionally adding a few extra seconds creates a better experience?

* [Wait for It...](http://uxmas.com/2013/wait-for-it)

### We are more concerned with how long a line is than how fast it's moving

Given a choice between a slow-moving short line and a fast-moving long one, we will often opt for the former, even if the waits are identical.

* [Why Waiting Is Torture](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html)

### People who wait less than they anticipated leave happier

This is why Disney, the universally acknowledged master of applied queuing psychology, overestimates wait times for rides.

* [Why Waiting Is Torture](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html)

### Occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied time

The experience of waiting is defined only partly by the objective length of the wait.

* [Why Waiting Is Torture](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html)

### Accelerate the progress and avoid pauses at the end

Progress bars with accelerating progress are strongly favored over decelerating progress.

* [How to Make Progress Bars Feel Faster to Users](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-to-make-progress-bars-feel-faster-to-users/)

### Increase the number of pulsations

A research study found that "the progress bar with increasing pulsation was more likely to be perceived as having a shorter duration".

* [How to Make Progress Bars Feel Faster to Users](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-to-make-progress-bars-feel-faster-to-users/)

### Use backwards moving ribbings

A research study found that progress bars with backwards moving ribbings seem faster to users than forwards moving ribbings.

* [How to Make Progress Bars Feel Faster to Users](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-to-make-progress-bars-feel-faster-to-users/)

### Making users wait too long is a user experience issue

If users get the feeling that your application loads too slow, they’ll grow impatient, and spend their time elsewhere.

* [How to Make Progress Bars Feel Faster to Users](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/how-to-make-progress-bars-feel-faster-to-users/)

### What do you eat when you’re starving?

"Anything" is probably the correct answer.
In other words, our expectations of something (...) obviously affect our appreciation of the outcome.

* [Let Your Users Wait](http://uxmag.com/articles/let-your-users-wait)

### Faster isn’t always better

When an action we perform happens faster than we would expect it to, we may not appreciate the effort put into it.
In more extreme cases we may think that if it happened too fast, maybe it didn’t happen at all.

* [Let Your Users Wait](http://uxmag.com/articles/let-your-users-wait)

### Avoid using static progress indicators

While any feedback is better than none, static indicators should be replaced with another type of indicator.

* [Progress Indicators Make a Slow System Less Insufferable](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/)

### An operation should only be represented by one indicator

For example, one refresh operation should not display both a refresh bar and an activity circle.

* [Progress & Activity](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html)

### If the percentage of completion is known, use a determinate indicator

They give users a quick sense of how long an operation will take.

* [Progress & Activity](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/progress-activity.html)
* [Progress Indicators Make a Slow System Less Insufferable](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/)

### Perceived speed matters a lot

Speed is critical and can make a huge difference to user experience, engagement and revenue.

* [Asynchronous UIs - the future of web user interfaces](http://old.alexmaccaw.com/posts/async_ui)

### Interactions should be resolved instantly

There should be no loading messages or spinners.
Requests to the server should be decoupled from the interface.

* [Asynchronous UIs - the future of web user interfaces](http://old.alexmaccaw.com/posts/async_ui)

### Users want to use your application without any interruptions

They don't give a damn if a request to the server is still pending.

* [Asynchronous UIs - the future of web user interfaces](http://old.alexmaccaw.com/posts/async_ui)

### Feedback is useful and doesn't block further interaction

Not all feedback is bad. Unobtrusive feedback that's actually useful to your users is completely fine.

* [Asynchronous UIs - the future of web user interfaces](http://old.alexmaccaw.com/posts/async_ui)

### Load Content Based On Importance, Not Order

If a lot of friends have liked something, load it first.

* [The 3 White Lies Behind Instagram's Lightning Speed](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669788/the-3-white-lies-behind-instagrams-lightning-speed)

### Use prerendering

When reading a blog, a lot of people will click "next post".
So you could get the next page ready before they even click it.

* [UX Tactics To Make Slow Things Seem Faster](http://blog.placeit.net/ux-tactics-make-slow-things-seem-faster/)

### Work ahead of the user

One example (from Instagram) is that whenever you pick a photo to share, as soon as you pick it, it uploads it.

* [UX Tactics To Make Slow Things Seem Faster](http://blog.placeit.net/ux-tactics-make-slow-things-seem-faster/)
* [The 3 White Lies Behind Instagram's Lightning Speed](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669788/the-3-white-lies-behind-instagrams-lightning-speed)

### Feedback shouldn't depend on servers

What this means is that no matter what your coverage situation is, you still get the visual feedback of your action.

* [UX Tactics To Make Slow Things Seem Faster](http://blog.placeit.net/ux-tactics-make-slow-things-seem-faster/)
* [The 3 White Lies Behind Instagram's Lightning Speed](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1669788/the-3-white-lies-behind-instagrams-lightning-speed)

### Use progressive image rendering

Progressive image rendering is when an image is loaded blurrily, and then becomes clearer as it finishes up.

* [UX Tactics To Make Slow Things Seem Faster](http://blog.placeit.net/ux-tactics-make-slow-things-seem-faster/)

### Give the user something to do

If people have something to do sitting in front of them, they're much less likely to be grumpy that they're waiting.

* [UX Tactics To Make Slow Things Seem Faster](http://blog.placeit.net/ux-tactics-make-slow-things-seem-faster/)

### Make buttons respond super-fast

All you have to do is make the button look pressed as soon as it’s pressed.

* [UX Tactics To Make Slow Things Seem Faster](http://blog.placeit.net/ux-tactics-make-slow-things-seem-faster/)
* [Progress Indicators Make a Slow System Less Insufferable](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/progress-indicators/)

### Interface should feel fast, regardless of network speed

Any action such as loading a new page or clicking a button should have an immediate reaction.

* [Non-blocking UI's with interface previews](http://www.callumhart.com/blog/non-blocking-uis-with-interface-previews)

### Don't block the parts that aren't dependent on the server

Which means that users are not forced to wait for the whole page to load before navigating away from it.

* [Non-blocking UI's with interface previews](http://www.callumhart.com/blog/non-blocking-uis-with-interface-previews)

### Client side rendering is a must

Interface previews would be very hard to achieve using the conventional server driven approach.

* [Non-blocking UI's with interface previews](http://www.callumhart.com/blog/non-blocking-uis-with-interface-previews)

### Separate placeholder elements from the real ones

Generally, their structure differs.

* [Non-blocking UI's with interface previews](http://www.callumhart.com/blog/non-blocking-uis-with-interface-previews)

### Test your designs at different internet speeds

Seeing how your app performs across slow networks gives you an insight into the degree to which interface previews should be used.

* [Non-blocking UI's with interface previews](http://www.callumhart.com/blog/non-blocking-uis-with-interface-previews)
* [Network Link Conditioner](http://nshipster.com/network-link-conditioner/)

### Give some indication of what is going on

This is exactly like putting a progress bar on a long action. Apart from the fact it's some fancy polish, it's great usability.

* [Facebook content placeholder deconstruction](http://cloudcannon.com/deconstructions/2014/11/15/facebook-content-placeholder-deconstruction.html)

### Waiting isn't positive, minimize it

Waiting means you're spending your time doing nothing because of something else that's out of your control.

* [Making Wait Times Feel Shorter](http://usabilitypost.com/2009/01/23/making-wait-times-feel-shorter/)

### Wait time presents us with is uncertainty

Uncertainty about when the wait will end (and indeed, in some cases uncertainty about whether anything is happening at all).

* [Making Wait Times Feel Shorter](http://usabilitypost.com/2009/01/23/making-wait-times-feel-shorter/)

### Absence of loading indicator lengthens perception

This means that without progress bars or some other indicators your application will feel slower to your users.
